## Learning Goals

- Summarize the uses and benefits of Python for web development
- Prepare your developer environment for programming with Python

# Reflection Questions

1. In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development? If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?

The difference betweeen frontend and backend development is the type of code that must be written and the tools that must be used. In frontend work, code is always related to HTML, CSS, and JS, because those are what browsers can interpret and create web pages with, while backend code has much more room for variation due to its 'disconnection' from the browser.

If I were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, I would be expected to maintain databases, manage authentication, and make secure data exchanges between servers and clients. 

2. Imagine you’re working as a full-stack developer in the near future. Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use JavaScript or Python for a project, and you think Python would be the better choice. How would you explain the similarities and differences between the two languages to your team? Drawing from what you learned in this Exercise, what reasons would you give to convince your team that Python is the better option?

When Python was designed in the 1990's, it was with prototyping and quick deployment in mind. Python is also famously easy to learn, using as close to regular text as possible, with dynamic typing in its variables and enforced indentation. It is easy to read and write with, so it will be easier to use for our project.

3. Now that you’ve had an introduction to Python, write down 3 goals you have for yourself and your learning during this Achievement.

   1. I want to learn how to use Python for backend programming, I've used it before, but never for something like server management.
   2. I want to build a functional app using Python, as I said earlier, I have used it before, but that was only for small projects while I was in high school, I'd love to get something fully operational out of it.
   3. I want to learn about the different kinds of imports there are in Python, we've used `math` and `bcrypt` already, but I look forward to seeing what others there are.

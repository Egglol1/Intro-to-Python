1. Create a structure named recipe_1 that contains the following keys:

 - name (str): Contains the name of the recipe
 - cooking_time (int): Contains the cooking time in minutes
 - ingredients (list): Contains a number of ingredients, each of the str data type

Decide what data structure you would use for this purpose, and in your README file in the repository for this task, describe in approx. 50-75 words why youâ€™ve chosen to use it.

I decided to use a disctionary for this structure because it is the closest to an object in Javascript. After spending such a long time working with JS in my past assignments, the structure of a JS object makes the most sense to me, and I like to use something similar in Python.

2. Create an outer structure called all_recipes, and then add recipe_1 to it. Figure out what type of structure you would consider for all_recipes, and briefly note down your justification in the README file.

3. I decided to use a list for the "all_recipes" structure, because it is easy to modify, unlike a tuple. I didn't use another dictionary because I didn't see a reason why it would be better than a list.
